# Ornis

_Ornis_ is an application that allows you to identify the birds you encounter on your walks in France. Then, learn more about their habits and behaviour! 

Want to see more birds? Use _Ornis_'s map system to know the general location of the bird species you hope to see and plan your next trip accordingly.

Made with the intent of protecting fauna in mind, _Ornis_ allows you to help ornithologists and bird protection societies by registering where you met a bird.

The name _Ornis_ comes from the Ancient Greek word for "bird".
