# Technical Stack 

A _technical stack_ is a collection of tools, frameworks or programming languages which help to develop, to deliver or to maintain a project.

### Front-end

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
* Bootstrap (CSS framework)
* JavaScript
* Vue.js

I use these front-end technical stacks because:

* _HTML_  is a language that is used to structure a web page and its content.

* _CSS_ is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.

* _Bootstrap_ is a free, open source, front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. Bootstrap is also interesting in building responsive pages with a grid with 12 columns and 6 breakpoints.

* _JavaScript_ is an object-oriented programming language usually used to create dynamic and interactive web content.

* _Vuejs_ is a  an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
