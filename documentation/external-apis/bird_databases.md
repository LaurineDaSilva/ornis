# [eBird](https://ebird.org/home)

[Open dataset](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000838205-download-ebird-data)

Made by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, used by eBird.

I got the key to the eBird API. It allows me to find bird species codes ever registered in a region (for France, for instance), and then, using the bird species code, I can get these bird species's taxonomy (their common name, their scientific name and many more pieces of information).

The problem is that the bird species registered in France include birds that do not normally live in France or in Europe, such as emeus, ostriches and many other species. My hypothesis is that birds from zoos may have been registered. 

I am looking for a way to better target birds from a specific region with this API, but I might need to find an API better suited to the needs of my application.

# [Avibase](https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp?lang=EN)

# [Nuthatch API](https://nuthatch.lastelm.software/)

This API's developer presents his project on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ornithology/comments/vdn7tn/any_coders_out_there_could_a_bird_api_be_useful/).

# [Xeno-Canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)

To find bird sounds.

# [Birdlife](http://www.datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis)

Distribution data (digitized maps) compiled by BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the World for the worldâ€™s birds. Not all of the world's birds are included because they omit sensitive species plus the Liverpool Pigeon.

# [Roboflow Bird Detection API](https://blog.roboflow.com/bird-detection-api/)

API to identify some bird species from a picture.
