# SWOT

## Strengths

- No app dedicated to bird identification in France only
- best known identification apps are not those about birds, there is room for more
- providing an observation journal

## Weaknesses

- Need to rely on external API, its terms of access could change anytime
- Existing apps include ones with sound indentification using microphone, picture ID using camera. However these two elements depend on the quality of the user's smartphone and I cannot make the sound ID of these apps work with my personal phone.
- Existing birding apps include some made in collaboration with ornithologists

## Opportunities

- fauna apps on France scope are not user-friendly, they have a dated interface and are not ergonomic

## Threats

- without a specific point of attraction demarking Ornis from the rest, the app will not be competitive when compared to Merlin Bird Id
- the fact that the best known identification apps are not those about birds might reflect a lack of interest from the public or an issue of communication about the existing apps
