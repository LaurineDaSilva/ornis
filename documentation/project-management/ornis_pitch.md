# Ornis's pitch

# Issues _Ornis_ answers to

- the ability to identify a bird by its aspect and its location. Maybe even by its sound or its picture.
- keeping a journal of the birds a user encounters and of their location.
- sharing birds encounters through a map system to facilitate bird counting.
- anticipating future trips in order to see specific species.

# Solution

- an app that references birds and allows to identify them.
- a map system.

# Potential users

- hikers
- people who have walks in parks
- bird-watching enthusiasts
- animal photographers
- hunters
- bird protection societies members
- ornithologists

# Points of attention

- application created with the intent of protecting animals and their habitat in mind. The map system may be a risk to birds if the location given is too precise.
- for the same reason, the vulnerability of certain species, such as threatened or rare species, should be taken into account.
- sexual dimorphism: differences of size and plumage colours between males and females of a same species may hinder the search feature.

 ## Possible solution

- a system of all public accounts and of authorized accounts for ornithologists and bird protection societies. The authorized accounts would imply administrative work to check the user's credentials.
- a limited precision of the map location system to avoid threatening birds. Maybe a more precise location system for authorized accounts.
