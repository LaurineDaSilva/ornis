# Prospects to include IoT with _Ornis_

## Making a *bird call* with Arduino

The idea would be to use Arduino to reproduce several bird calls. Instead of having a traditional, wooden bird call making the sounds of one species, the user could use the connected object to simulate the sound of the species around them.

For instance, in a forest near woodpeckers, the user could use the app and the Arduino to simulate a woodpecker sound. Near a river, they could simulate a duck sound with the same objects.

It is possible to program notes into an Arduino. This would require a good quality *speaker*.
