# Sound Recording 

A theme to explore to allow users to record bird sounds and to add the tracks to their observation journal.

Maybe even go further and compare sounds recorded to sounds from xeno-canto or other.

-> Sound recognition?

## Arduino

Questions:
- What do I do with the captured sound afterwards?
- How do I access the recorded sounds from a web app?
- Can I obtain data from Arduino with the browser?
- My app will be mainly used from a smartphone, what is the added value of using a connected object compared to using the smartphone directly?

(In terms of learning, it would allow me to get experience in [Internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) but would any user need justify it?)

## Raspberry Pi

## JavaScript / VueJS

### Native JavaScript

The MediaDevices interface provides access to connected media input devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing. In essence, it lets you obtain access to any hardware source of media data.

`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
