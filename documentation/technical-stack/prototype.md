# Prototype

A prototype is a model of a product that focuses on functionality, which gives your stakeholders a taste of the final version and allows them to check that the design is usable.

Objectives:
* To see the validation and the navigation
* To see the functionality
* To see the design process
* To see the test designs
* To see if it is worth going to the next step
