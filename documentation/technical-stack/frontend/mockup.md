# Mock-up

## What is a mock-up ?

A mockup or mock-up is a visual representation of an application and helps to evaluate the design and functional elements from a user point of view.

There are many types of mockup :
- zoning
- wireframe
- mockup
- prototype

But for the project, we are going to use the zoning and the wireframe.

The _zoning_ is a rough plan that helps determinate where the blocks of content (footer, navbar, body...) will be located in the application, while the _wireframe_ is a functional mock-up with little graphics or simple graphics.

## What is a graphic charter?

A graphic charter helps to develop the company's visual identity.
For example with the colors, the font, the logo or pictures...

If the graphic charter is respected, it assures a consistency with all communication supports.

For the _Ornis_ project, I am going to use _Bootstrap_ and _Google Fonts_.

Bootstrap is a free, open source, front-end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. Bootstrap is also interesting in building responsive pages with a grid with 12 columns and 6 breakpoints.
