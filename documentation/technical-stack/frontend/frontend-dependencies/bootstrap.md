# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications).

The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.

Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers.

In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

It provides a collection of pre-designed and pre-built components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and more, along with a responsive grid system. Bootstrap simplifies and accelerates the process of designing and developing modern and responsive web applications.

## Key Features

Key features of Bootstrap include:

- Responsive Grid System: Bootstrap includes a responsive, 12-column grid layout system that adapts to different screen sizes. This makes it easier to create websites that work well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- Pre-designed Components: Bootstrap comes with a set of CSS styles and JavaScript plugins for common UI components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, carousels, and more. These components are designed to be consistent and visually appealing.

- Customizable Styles: While Bootstrap provides a default set of styles, it is also highly customizable. Developers can easily customize the look and feel of Bootstrap components using custom CSS, or they can use the official Sass version of Bootstrap to leverage variables and mixins for more advanced customization.

- Responsive Utilities: Bootstrap includes responsive utility classes that enable developers to show or hide elements based on screen size. This helps in creating adaptive layouts.

- JavaScript Components: Bootstrap includes a set of JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of components. Examples include modal dialogs, tooltips, popovers, and carousels.

- Browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to be compatible with popular browsers, helping ensure a consistent experience for users across different platforms.
