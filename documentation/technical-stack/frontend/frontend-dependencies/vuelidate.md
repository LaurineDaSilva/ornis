# Vuelidate

Vuelidate is a form validation library. It is considered model-based because the validation rules are defined next to your data, and the validation tree structure matches the data model structure.

## Key features

Here are some key features and concepts associated with Vuelidate:

- Declarative Validation Rules: Vuelidate allows you to define validation rules for form fields in a declarative manner using the Vue.js template syntax.

- Integration with Vue Components: Vuelidate seamlessly integrates with Vue components, allowing you to attach validation rules to data properties in your components.

- Validation Functions: Validation rules are expressed as functions, making it easy to customize and extend the validation logic for each form field.

- Validation States: Vuelidate provides information about the validation state of each form field, allowing you to conditionally style or display error messages based on the validation results.

- Async Validation: It supports asynchronous validation, which is useful when you need to perform validation checks that involve asynchronous operations, such as making an API call.

- Validation Groups: Vuelidate allows you to group fields together for validation, enabling you to validate multiple fields simultaneously.
