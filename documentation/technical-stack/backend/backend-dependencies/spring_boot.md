## spring-boot-starter-parent

The spring-boot-starter-parent project is a special starter project that provides default configurations for our application and a complete dependency tree to quickly build our Spring Boot project. It also provides default configurations for Maven plugins, such as maven-failsafe-plugin, maven-jar-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, and maven-war-plugin.

Beyond that, it also inherits dependency management from spring-boot-dependencies, which is the parent to the spring-boot-starter-parent.

## spring-boot-starter-web

Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Tomcat as the default embedded container.
