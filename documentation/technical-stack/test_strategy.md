# Test Strategy

A test strategy helps to define uniform testing procedures.
We can find different types of tests as :

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* User Acceptance Test

User Acceptance Test helps to identify and develop test scenarios by the client or end user. It is done after functional, integration and system testing. Thereby, the UAT makes sure that the product corresponds with business requirements and can be used by the end user.

* a test scenario with data input
